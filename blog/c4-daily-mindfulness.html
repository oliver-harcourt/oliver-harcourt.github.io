              <p>
                I read this chapter before doing the sprint and I'm glad I did, a bit of mindfulness was 
                definitely necessary during this one! I had a good 'mindfulness conversation' with my 
                brother on the drive back from a ski trip. It was not much different from a regular 
                conversation I didn't think but was good to be mindful and paying meta-attention to the 
                conversation. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Of the suggested techniques I think I'll incorporate taking one breath a day. I think that 
                counts as the other suggested technique of doing less than you can too, and I feel like its 
                a good initial habit builder.
