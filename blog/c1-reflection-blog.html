    <h1>Reflections on the EDA Journey</h1>
    <h2>01 August 2018<em></em> </h2>

      Having not written a blog before I'm thinking about this far too much... So the way I'll tackle it is to just type what I'm thinking and let it (hopefully) take form. The EDA experience appeals to me in a big way so far. All through university I was frustrated with the drawn out style of learning and just how long the whole thing took. It wasn't intensive and because of that it wasn't imperative to get work done and allowed for letting things get to the last minute. So really disengaging. From what I can tell, Dev Academy is too short of a timeframe and far too intensive to let that happen. I'm also really looking forward to the challenge of bootcamp, having always been a bit unsure about group working.

      My impression so far are that everyone involved is really passionate about what theyre doing. Those running the course seem excited about the process and the journey, which definitely helps to get me pumped for the whole thing too.
