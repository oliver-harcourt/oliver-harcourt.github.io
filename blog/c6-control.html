                When programming, my biggest trigger is code that doesn't make sense to me and then trying to read up 
                on the code that is the issue, only to not even understand the language used to try and describe it. 
                There seems to be a certain way developers talk about how code works, maybe it's the only way to 
                describe it but it's doing my head in!

                I found the Siberian North Railroad exercise interesting but it didn't reveal too much unfortunately (or 
                maybe that's a good thing?). The habit of stopping and taking a breath is one that I'm quite keen on already 
                and I feel like with just doing that the other steps of the process naturally follow.
