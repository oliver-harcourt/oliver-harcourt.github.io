              </div>
                <p>
                  The problem that I got most stuck on was the Chessboard. I carefully read through what I had 
                  written (although in the end not carefully enough to notice the difference between "/n" and "\n"), 
                  spent a good amount of time googling and looking through forums like stack overflow for similar problems, 
                  thought about giving it all up and going to live in a commune and grow tomatoes forever, then re-read the 
                  code and noticed the "\"" vs "/" error. I think the biggest take-away from that existential crisis was 
                  to read through code veeeery carefully, attention to detail!
                </p>
            <h4 class="title">Simple problem with elegant solution</h4>
              <p>
                I'm not sure if I solved any of the problems in this sprint 'elegantly'. I either knw what needed to be done 
                or went through a process of reding through code, identifying areas I didn't understand, researching them to 
                gain more understanding, then implementing what I had learned.
              </p>
            <h4 class="title">Problem solving techniques and confidence using them</h4>
              <p>
                I'm very confident researching the problem and working through it various ways myself, I don't feel 
                so great asking peers or coaches for help though. I'm worried that it'll be an easy solve and I'll be 
                pestering someone for no reason!
