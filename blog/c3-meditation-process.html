              <p>
                My thoughts on meditation before reading chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself were slightly 
                skeptical, and probably still are. I definitely see huge merits in practicing mindfulness 
                but I'm a bit dubious as to how much of a wonder drug/activity it is claimed to be. In 
                saying that, I definitely think it has amazing benefits and will definitely be trying to 
                make regular meditation a habit.

                Something new I learned about meditation was how adept Buddhist meditators are able to generate 
                high-amplitude gamma brain waves, which are associated with high effectiveness in memory, 
                learning, and perception. Meditation training can also change your brain 
                at rest.
