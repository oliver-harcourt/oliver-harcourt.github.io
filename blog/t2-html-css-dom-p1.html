    <h1>HTML CSS and the DOM</h1>
    <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>
      <p>HTML is the basic structure of your webpage and then CSS is the style added to it. 
          So most anologies that include building something can work. For building a house
          the blueprint, foundation, framing, walls, roof, rooms, would be HTML and then the decoration
          like paint or types of carpet would be CSS. comparing it to a person, their bones,
          skin, muscles and organs are HTML whereas the clothes they wear, style of haircut,
          and type of perfume they use, would be CSS. 
      </p>
      <p>The DOM is a little harder to incorporate into these analogies but let's give it a go... 
          The HTML is the initial blueprint that wont change but the DOM is the implementation of
          that blueprint when building the house. It can be done in different ways depending on who is 
          using it but any changes made wont affect the initial blueprint.

    <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
      <p>Boxifying is the process of breaking down a web-page design into a series of individual 
          boxes, making it easier to understand.</p>
    <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
      <p>The Box Model consists of margins, borders, padding and content. Together they make up 
          every HTML element on the page. Each of these can be adjusted to create different 
          styles, effects and spacing.</p>
