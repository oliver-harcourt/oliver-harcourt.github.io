              <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
                <p>A grid based design is a flexible way to design a webpage using a 12-colomn grid.
                    Each row of the page is divided into equal sized, 12 columns in order to maximise
                    the stylistic options. 12 is the number used because it means that you can divide 
                    the page easily in half using 2 x 6 columns, or into 3 using 3 x 4 columns, or 4 
                    using 4 x 3 columns. A higher number isn't used because a page divided more than 
                    4 times is bad design and 2,3, and 4 all divide evenly into 12.

              <h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
                <p>Responsive webpages are really important now with all the different devies people
                    are visiting the internet on. Due to the different size and shape of the different 
                    devices screens, it's important to have webpages that load properly and adjust to 
                    whatever device the page is visited on.

              <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
                <p>Semantic structure is refering to writing out the HTML file in such a way that the 
                    information is reinforced and portrayed as it is intended. For example, using the 
                    h1, h2, h3.. and so on in a sensible fashion, with h1 being your most important 
                    header followed by h2 etc.
